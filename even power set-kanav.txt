Even Power Set
 
 You are given a set A having N integers.
 
 Print the number of sets having even size in the power set.
 
 Note
 The power set of a set A is the set of all subsets of A including the null set and set itself.
 A = {a, b, c} then P(A) = {{}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a,b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}.
 
 Function Description
 In the provided code snippet, implement the provided powerSet(...) method using the variables to print the number of sets from power set having an even size. You can write your code in the space below the phrase “WRITE YOUR LOGIC HERE”. 
 
 There will be multiple test cases running so the Input and Output should match exactly as provided.
 
 Input Format
 The first line contains N denoting the size of the array.
 The next line contains N space-separated integers of the set. 
 
 Sample Input
 3 -- denotes N
 1 2 3 -- denotes N elements
 
 Constraints
 1<=N<=10^2
 1<=A[i]<=10^4
 
 Output Format
 The output contains the number of sets from power set having even size.
 
 Sample Output
 4
