Tom and Jerry
 
 Tom and Jerry decide to buy some toys with the money they have. All the toys are different, but their cost can be the same.
 Tom only buys the toys whose cost is even, and Jerry buys the toys whose cost is odd.
 Find the maximum number of toys Tom and Jerry can buy respectively.
 
 Note
 Every toy can be bought only once.
 
 Function Description
 In the provided code snippet, implement the provided tomAndJerry(...) method using the variables to print the maximum number of toys Tom and Jerry can buy respectively. You can write your code in the space below the phrase “WRITE YOUR LOGIC HERE”. 
 
 There will be multiple test cases running so the Input and Output should match exactly as provided.
 
 Input Format
 The first line of input contains three space-separated integers N, T, and J denoting the number of toys in the shop, money with Tom, and money with Jerry respectively.
 The second line of input contains N space-separated integers denoting the cost of the toys.
 
 Sample Input
 10 54 75 --denotes N, T, J
 12 34 25 32 10 15 20 39 29 30 --denotes cost of N toys
 
 Output Format
 The output contains two space-separated integers denoting the maximum number of toys Tom and Jerry can buy respectively.
 
 Sample Output
 3 3
 
 Explanation
 Tom can buy toys costing 10, 34, 32, 10, 20, 30.
 Jerry can buy toys costing 25, 15, 39, 29.
